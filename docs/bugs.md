# Confirmed bugs

This file tries to list confirmed bugs in units, buildings and others. It won't include interface glitches.

## Definitely bugs

### Imperial IDT Traps

The [Imperial dropship trap](empireTrapDropship.html) at level 11 generates 5 stormtroopers instead of 4 heavy troopers. Only the Imperial faction suffers from this. See below for the Rebel IDT Trap.

  * **Analysis:** The [Imperial Dropship](ImperialDropship.html) called by the trap at level 11 is not the same as the [Imperial Dropship](ImperialDropshipTrap.html) at level 10 and below (they bear the same name, but have different ID). The one at level 11 is the same as the usual dropship (buildable in the factory) whereas the one called by the trap gives heavy troopers. None of these are skinnable (they are not regular or heavy troopers, even if they look very similar).
  * **Bug confirmed:** yes, multiple sources. Waiting for a timestamp and an official test. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vvc7FDqrkt0&
  * **Bug confirmation process:** (not required)

### Rebel V-4X-D Ski Speeder

The [Rebel V-4X-D Ski Speeder](PolarShip.html) has a displayed damage that is going down from level 9 to level 11 (instead of up) without any other stats increasing. The calculated damage increases from level 9 to 10, but drops at level 11 (below level 7).

  * **Analysis:**
    * _displayed damage_: The displayed damage per second is computed correctly according to the current formula until level 9. The level 10 value was diminished in update 1171 (the Prestige one) so that it would seem to increase from level 10 to 11. In a posterior update, the level 11 was re-computed in version 1176 or 1177 from a wrong value to a wrong value (according to the current formula), but a bit larger (so that it would show better, possibly).
    * _computed damage_: The computed damage drops with level 11 because the shot delay is 300 ms instead of 200 ms (so the fire rate drops).
  * **Bug confirmed:** not yet
  * **Bug confirmation process:** to be done

### Enhanced AT-AP Walker / Enhanced AT-MP Walker   (and possibly other units with splash damage) vs shields

The [Enhanced AT-AP Walker](eqpRebelATAPHalfSkin.html) / [Enhanced AT-MP Walker](eqpEmpireATMPHalfSkin.html) takes a very long
time to destroy shields, more than the unskinned [AT-AP
Walker](ATAP.html) / [AT-MP
Walker](ATMP.html). While this could be at a quick glance attributed to
a modifier versus shields of +300% instead of +400%, the maths doesn't
hold as a shield takes 4 times more to be destroyed by the (supposedly)
more powerful unit.

As detailed in the *analysis* below, the damage may be related to splash
projectiles and shields. So this bug may also apply to other units with
splash damage : [Rebel Hailfire droid](Hailfire.html), [AAT-1 Hover
Tank](AAT1.html) and [Rebel Vanguard](Vanguard.html) at least, and their
imperial counterparts [Enhanced AT-MP
Walker](eqpEmpireATMPHalfSkin.html) skin and [Mobile Heavy
Cannon](MHC.html), [2-M Hover Tank](2MTank.html) and [Shock
Trooper](Shock.html) (plus the skins of the unskinned units that keep
the splash damage).

  * **Analysis:** This bug was quite difficult to interpret, however a
    very credible explanation was found in the data mining group
    (Shelendil was probably the first to come up with an
    explanation). The computation by ResDog goes like this:

> _(ResDog)_ Math seems to check out Shelendil. In the video, it takes the
> reg AT-AP 12 shots to kill the shield, and the enhanced 41
> shots. Assuming that was a level 8 shield gen, with 83,900 health, 41
> shots is 2,046/shot. Using Papa's math, it should be doing
> 10,482/shot, but if you take 20% of the number, it's 2,096/shot.
>
> _(Shelendil)_ For those values it would take 40.03 shots to kill.

  * The implications are quite far reaching, because beside the units
    mentioned above, a lot of units with splash damage are stopped by
    shields. Thus the computation needs to be confirmed for other units.
    A possible explanation is as follows: when a splash projectile hits,
    the targets in range are tested. But due to the nature of the
    shield, when the target hits the shield, the distance between the
    shield and the projectile impact point is computed badly and ends up
    in a further range rather than the normal 100% center. It is also
    possible that large buildings suffer from the same defect. All of
    this needs a large test initiative. As of now, only the ATAP is confirmed.
  * **Bug confirmed:** 2018-11-29 by Tye Peer (JJO/J-Reb), video posted to Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCl04u9edjY
  * **Bug confirmation process:** Attack in the campaign scenarios against a (probably level 8) shield in two variants : a regular AT-AP of level 10, and a level 10 skin level 1 AT-AP (+180% damage).


## Design bugs

### Prestige A-Wings/TIE Advanced vs Shields

The [A-wing](AWing.html) at prestige level cannot pierce an [imperial shield](empireShieldGenerator.html).

The situation is symmetric for Empire [TIE Advanced](TieAdvanced.html) vs [rebel shields](rebelShieldGenerator.html).

  * **Analysis:** The problem is clear from the numbers. This may have been an overlook by the dev team, or a conscious design decision to make defence at level 11 easier.
  * **Bug confirmed:** yes, multiple sources. Waiting for a timestamp and an official test.

### Rebel IDT Traps

As expressed above, the [Rebel IDT trap](rebelTrapDropship.html) is only a bit healthier, costs more to rearm, but does not drop better troops.

  * **Analysis:** The [Clone Wars Gunship](CloneWarsGunshipTrap.html) was not given a level 11, so the trap is set to simply use the level 10. Other stats of the trap were increased in a seemingly sound way.
  * **Bug confirmed:** yes, multiple sources. Waiting for a timestamp and an official test.
  * **Bug confirmation process:** (not required)

### A-A5 Speeder Truck and Imperial Troop Transport : Units without a prestige level

While this may be by design, a number of playable units don't have a
prestige level.

All mercenaries, all creatures have no prestige level.

The [Rebel A-A5 Speeder Truck](RebelTransportVehicle.html) also has no prestige level, as well as the [Imperial Troop Transport](EmpireTransportVehicle.html).

  * **Analysis:** There is no prestige level. The fragment follows the same as the mercenaries for AA5 and ITT.
  * **Bug confirmed:** yes, multiple sources.
  * **Bug confirmation process:** (not required)

## Older (fixed) bugs

### Prestige medic droids/repair droids

The [medic droid](Medic.html) at level 11 doesn't heal units beyond the one he locked on at level 11 (Prestige).
The [repair droid](Technician.html) at level 11 is probably affected too.

Bug fixed as of update 2003. Also the same bug existed for dewbacks (and not banthas).
